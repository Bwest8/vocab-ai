2. **Focus States**: Clear focus rings on interactive elements
3. **Touch Targets**: All targets meet iOS/Android guidelines

## Files Modified

1. `app/components/Navigation.tsx` (NEW)

3. `app/globals.css`
4. `app/page.tsx`
5. `app/study/page.tsx`
6. `app/create/page.tsx`

All changes maintain backward compatibility and gracefully degrade on older browsers.
